# Green endophytes
ONT sequencing of green endophytes.

This repository contains the code and data for the analysis of green endophytes. The data was generated using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing.

The folder "scripts" contains code for running analyses. 

*Update 2024-07-28:* Added a database of refrence sequences for the tufA gene. Main sources:
